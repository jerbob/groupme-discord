# GroupMeDiscord

This fork is deprecated by a rewritten version of this written in Go to make it easier to deploy and it just works better for me personally. https://github.com/karmanyaahm/groupme_discord_bridge_v3

Some Python scripts to interface between Discord and GroupMe.

## Requirements
These scripts require Python 3.6+. <br/>
Before starting, make sure that you install the requirements with:
```bash
cd ~/path/to/GroupMe/
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you have issues with the discord.py installation, use the following command:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/archive/rewrite.zip#egg=discord.py
```
You also need to be able to **expose the flask webserver.** <br/>
If you already know how to do this, change the `run_locally` variable in `config.ini` to `false`. <br/> <br/>
If not, The easiest method to do this is by using the ngrok tool. View the documentation [here](https://ngrok.com/). <br/>
Once ngrok is setup and authorized, execute the following command to recieve your ngrok URL (you'll need this later):
```bash
ngrok http 5000
```
Keep this process running as you start the application.
### Discord Bot
In order to send messages from Discord to GroupMe, you will need to create a Bot Application. <br>
To do this, first go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and login with your Discord account. 
Click "New App", fill in your App name, then click "Create App".

You should be redirected to the application page of your bot. <br/> Scroll down to the following prompt and select "Create a Bot User": <br/>

You will now be able to view the token of your bot application.

Copy this token and paste it into your `config.ini` file:

### Webhook
The webserver will be sending GroupMe messages to a dedicated channel by using a Discord Webhook. <br/>
To create a webhook, navigate to a channel's edit page and select "Webhooks". <br>
After creating a webhook, copy the webhook URL shown: <br/>

And paste it into your config file:

There's just one more thing to do on the Discord side: enable User Settings -> Appearance -> Developer Mode and right click the channel that the webhook is using. Paste this number into your config file too:

## GroupMe
Now that you've set up the Discord constants, you'll also need to setup your GroupMe Bot. <br/>
Navigate to https://dev.groupme.com/bots, login with your GroupMe account, and click "Create Bot".

Fill in the appropriate fields, and in the **Callback URL** field, enter the URL that you got from ngrok.

Once you've created the Bot, click on the bot's field to see the **Bot ID**. Copy this string and paste it in your config file: <br/>

One more to go! On the same page, click the "Access Token" button to retrieve your access token.
Copy this string and paste it into your config file: <br/>

You should see any messages appear in the chosen Discord channel, and you will also be able to send messages and images to the GroupMe chat.
